## Python Assignment: Basic Input, Output, Variables, and Conditional Statements

### Objective:
Create a program that asks the user for their age and determines if they are eligible to vote.

### Instructions:
1. **Input**: Prompt the user to enter their age.
2. **Variables**: Store the user's age in a variable.
3. **Conditional Statements**: Use an `if` statement to check if the user is eligible to vote.
4. **Output**: Print a message indicating whether the user can vote or not.

### Examples
```python
Please enter your age: 45
You are eligible to vote.

Please enter your age: 14
You are not eligible to vote.
```
### Additional Challenge (Optional):
- Modify the program to handle invalid input (e.g., negative numbers or non-numeric input).
- Add more conditions to provide different messages for different age groups (e.g., "You are a teenager" for ages 13-19).
